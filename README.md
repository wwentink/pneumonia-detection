# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in chest x-ray scans using convulutional neural networks. Pneumonia is a serious infection which can be life threatening especially in vunerable populations. 

Through training on a public chest scan dataset, this model is able to distinguish between pneumonia-infected and healthy lungs with a F1-score of 90. Demonstrating how this technology can be used to help medical professionals provide faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Features
